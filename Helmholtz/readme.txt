Helmholtz Folder
--------------------------
Contains scripts for performing symbolic regression on DNN output. 
For each of the three packages, the SR is performed on perfect data generated by the Helmholtz equations and then another time on the output of a DNN that infers the Helmholtz equations. 

Helmholtz Equation Information:
* u = sin(a1*pi*x) * sin(a2*pi*y)
* (u_xx + u_yy) + k**2 * u = g
* a1 = 1.2, a2 = 5.4

The folders are as following:
gplearn - Code for GPLearn symbolic regression
AI Feynman v2- Code for AI-Feynman 2.0 symbolic regression (immediately takes in .txt files)
PySR - Code for PySR symbolic regression
