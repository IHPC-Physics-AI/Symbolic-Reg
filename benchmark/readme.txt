gplearn - contains code to process dataset .txt files (by Tegmark) into readable arrays, code for GPLearn symbolic regression
AI Feynman v2- code for AI-Feynman 2.0 symbolic regression (immediately takes in .txt files). Contains data discrepancy, to be resolved.
PySR - contains code to process dataset .txt files (by Tegmark) into readable arrays, code for PySR symbolic regression. Contains data discrepancy, to be resolved.

Note: originally there was a subfolder called tegmark_data - containing datasets for 10 basic equations and 20 advanced equations provided by Tegmark et al. The data files were too big to upload via GitHub. Instead, find them here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RQiv9Jj_zdI0TxwJ1f_qZgvPxte-t1t2?usp=sharing 

Note: dataset files for 10 basic equations (I_0_0.txt) and 20 complex equations (test_0.txt) are found in AI Feynman_v2 folder (not included in this repository).
