# Symbolic-Regression


This repository contains five Symbolic Regression Experiments:
  1. Tests
  2. Benchmark
  3. Lotka-Volterra
  4. Helmholtz
  5. Caffeine

### Running Scripts
Please refer to each folder's individual ReadMe file for more information. Each folder contains scripts for three symbolic regressor packages: AI Feynman 2.0, PySR, and GPLearn. The scripts are compatible with package versions as of 19/08/23. The scripts were tested on Google Colab so minor changes regarding the current directory and OS commands may need to be made. Upon running, the scripts will generate data files in your local folder.

### Credits 
This is not an official IHPC product, but please credit this work if this is helpful to you.

The scripts and repository are the work of interns and colleagues from the Institute of High Performance Computing, A*STAR, Singapore. 

Please email Ooi Chin Chun for any inquiries.
