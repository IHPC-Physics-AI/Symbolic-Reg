Caffeine Folder
--------------------------
Contains scripts for performing symbolic regression on caffeine pharmacokinetics equations. 
For each of the three packages, the SR is performed on perfect data generated by an ODE solver for the following system of equations:
d(A1 / V1) / dt = -Ka * (A1 / V1)
d(A1 / V2) / dt = Ka * (A1 / V1) - Ke * (A2 / V2)

The folders are as following:
y = Ka_A1: Symbolic regression on y = Ka*A1 using three different packages
y = Ke_A2:Symbolic regression on y = Ke*A2 using three different packages
y = Ka_A1 - Ke_A2: Symbolic regression on y = Ka*A1 - Ke*A2 using three different packages
Text Files: any text or npy files generated while running each scripts. Note: scripts will contain methods to visualize the files in the folder so no need to look at the text outputs.
